* Creates an upload destination, returning the information required to upload a file to the destination and to programmatically access the file.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 10 | 10 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here.
